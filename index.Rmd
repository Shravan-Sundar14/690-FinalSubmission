This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees. This data interpretation was made with the hope to enable our community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights.

The data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic i.e. **11 March 2020** to present (**20 April 2024**).\
